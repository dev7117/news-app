"""The worker MCP endpoint, /mcp/agent: what an agent working a task can do.

todo-agent starts `claude -p --agent <name>` with an MCP config pointing here and a bearer
token issued when it claimed the run. The token only works while that run is live, and every
tool acts on that run's task (or one of its children). It's a separate server from /mcp, so
an agent never even sees the user's full toolset; the API token isn't accepted here.
