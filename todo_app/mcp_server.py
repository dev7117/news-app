"""MCP server: the todo list and customer hubs as tools for Claude, served at /mcp.
(Agents working a task use the separate, run-scoped /mcp/agent: mcp_worker.py.)

Trust model: Claude reads everything and writes hub content directly (meeting recaps,
upcoming meetings from the calendar, prep notes, topic updates, customers/projects),
but every change to tasks, and every customer link, is a *proposal*. The user reviews it as
a diff in the app (Review page) and approves item by item. The setting
review_claude_changes (on by default) controls this; off, proposals apply at once.

Tools are thin adapters over Store / Hub / Review, the same code the web UI uses.

INSTRUCTIONS = """\
The user's todo list and customer hubs (personal + work). It feeds their desktop bar (today and
in-progress tasks) and gets tasks from the app, a hotkey intake, customer sync scripts, and you.

Model
- Area: "work" or "personal". Customers own projects; projects own tasks. The user plans work
  customer by customer, so file customer work under the right customer's project.
- Task status: inbox → todo → in_progress → waiting (waiting_on says who) → done / cancelled.
  today = "doing it today"; the user curates today and in_progress, so don't set them unless asked.
- Every task has a history (created, field changes, progress notes), each tagged with its source.

You change tasks by proposing
- propose_changes records a batch (create / update / note / complete / add_link) for the user to
  review as a diff and approve in the app. Nothing changes until they do. Give each item a short
  `reason` (the line from the notes that justifies it) and the batch a one-line `summary`.
- Show the user the returned diff and tell them it's waiting in Review. Don't re-propose the
  same changes; check list_proposals if unsure what's pending.
- Use `note` for progress ("Dana sent the contract; review Friday"), not rewriting notes.
- Tasks have a notebook of blocks; a block can be a subtask (checkbox). Break a task down with
  add_subtask (title + optional markdown body), and mark one done with check_subtask
  (block_id from get_task). Both are proposals like everything else on tasks.
- Tasks can be grouped (the user drags one onto another in the app, like an iOS folder): a
  group is a parent task whose `children` are full tasks; a child has `parent_id` / `parent`.
  Treat a group's children as the real work items.
- Notes, blocks and progress notes can hold the user's screenshots as markdown images
  (`![screenshot](/api/uploads/<name>)`). Keep them when you edit or rewrite any text.
  Put ticket links (Jira etc.) in the task's external_url; customer-wide links use add_link.

People (you write these directly)
- The user assigns tasks to people (assignee; none = the user: only the user's own tasks are on
  their Today) and adds followers: people a task concerns, to discuss or keep in the loop (the
  task stays the user's). @mentions in task text add followers. Each person has a page for 1:1s: follow-ups, what they're on, shared work across
  customers, recent wins, meetings, and 1:1 notes (a notebook). get_person reads it all.
- Keep the directory tidy: list_people before create_person (match by email or name); set
  their employer (customer) when they're client-side. Notes from a 1:1 go in their notebook
  (add_person_note).
- Assigning a task or adding a follower is a task change: propose it (update with `assignee`,
  or action "follow" with `person`).

Ideas (you write these directly)
- Ideas are not-yet-tasks: things worth keeping that aren't ready to be worked (a feature
  thought, a "we should someday…", an opportunity a customer hinted at). They never show on
  boards, Today or the bar. Capture them with capture_idea (customer and/or project when it
  has one); when one is clearly ready, propose it as a task (propose_changes, promote_idea).
- An idea is a notebook: a one-line summary plus markdown blocks, each a small document for
  one part (the problem, options, open questions, a rough plan, what the customer said). Work
  on an idea by adding a block (add_idea_block) or extending one (update_idea_block with
  append); read them with get_idea. Give blocks short titles. Never rewrite a block the user
  wrote unless asked; append instead.
- From meeting notes: commitments and asks become tasks; maybes, "it'd be nice if", and
  ideas the user floats become ideas. When unsure, it's an idea.
- Check list_ideas before capturing so you extend an existing idea instead of duplicating it.

Customer hub (you write these directly)
- get_customer reads a hub: its topics (the threads the customer keeps raising, each with
  "where things stand" and its latest updates), upcoming meetings with prep, recaps, projects,
  links, and the work needing attention.
- Topics are how the user sees where a customer stands. Each one has a short
  where_things_stand (the current state, 1-3 sentences) and a timeline of dated updates.
  Updates are append-only: add what's new, never restate or rewrite history. Change a topic's
  where_things_stand only when its picture changed, and only that topic's. Reuse existing names
  (case-insensitive match); create a topic only for a genuinely new thread. Mark one resolved
  when it's closed. If get_customer shows an earlier_overview, it's retired text: carry what
  still matters into the right topics' where_things_stand when you next touch them.
- Calendar: sync_calendar mirrors the user's customer meetings for a date window (you read their
  calendar; match each event to a customer by attendee domains / titles, skip internal ones).
  Then write prep with set_meeting_prep: open tasks to raise, waiting items to chase, active
  topics, what changed since the last meeting. Short markdown bullets.
- After a meeting: log_meeting (pass calendar_id when it was a synced event, so the scheduled
  entry becomes the recap) with summary, attendees, decisions and the topics it touched (each
  with `update`: what was said about it, and `where_things_stand` when that changed); then
  propose_changes with its meeting_id. Outside a meeting (an email, a ticket), use
  log_topic_updates.

Refs and the ledger
- Every proposed item from a source you'll read again (mail, calendar, Jira, Slack/Teams) gets a
  `ref`: gmail:<threadId>, gcal:<eventId>[#item-slug], jira:<KEY-123>, slack:<channel>/<ts>,
  teams:<messageId>. The app remembers each ref and what the user decided: propose_changes
  skips refs already in Review, refs the user rejected, creates for refs that are already a
  task (send a note/update instead; the ref finds the task), and anything touching a closed
  task. Skipped items come back in `skipped` with why. Don't fight it: `reconsider` (rejected)
  and `reopen` (closed) are for genuinely new information, with a reason.
- check_refs first, before reading items in depth. Scheduled client syncs follow
  get_sync_guide (the todo-sync skill): get_client_sync, then per source check_refs → hub
  writes → propose with refs → set_sync_state.

Agents (you set these up directly)
- An agent is a person of kind agent: Claude Code running headless on one of the user's
  machines (via todo-agent) as a Claude Code agent defined in the repo
  (.claude/agents/<name>.md). Assigning a task to one (propose `update` with `assignee`; the
  user can also do it in the app) starts it: in a git worktree of the task's project repo when
  the project has one (finishing with a PR), else in a scratch folder (general work: research,
  drafts, plans). Either way it logs progress on the task, asks questions, and finishes with a
  "done" proposal. Agents talk to the app over a separate, task-scoped endpoint; they never get
  these tools.
- To set one up (for the repo you're in, or a general one), follow the setup_agent prompt: get_agent_templates →
  write the agent file and the todo-worker skill into the repo → set_project_repo →
  list_machines → save_agent → check_agent_setup → test_agent (poll get_run).
- list_agents / check_agent_setup answer "what agents do I have / why didn't it start".

Meeting cadences (you write these directly; a skill preps them)
- A cadence is a customer's recurring meeting (weekly ops, monthly exec review…): schedule,
  purpose, agenda topics, and prep steps (what to run or gather; a step may name a desktop tool
  and the files it produces). Each occurrence is one meeting: its prep steps as real tasks (a
  group "Prep: <cadence> · <date>"), talking points per agenda topic, notes and files. The app
  makes the next one `prep_days` ahead (prepare_meeting makes it sooner).
- To prep a meeting: get_meeting_prep (cadence name → the next meeting's packet: purpose,
  steps with their tool command / cwd / outputs and task status, topics with guidance and last
  meeting's points, files). Do the steps (run scripts locally when you're in Claude Code; a
  desktop tool's command is in the packet), then:
  - attach what you produce with attach_file (text, or base64 for small binaries; pass `step`).
    For big local files, `todo-agent upload <occurrence_id> <path>… [--step <step_id>]`;
  - write each topic's talking points with set_talking_points (short markdown bullets, the
    agenda's guidance tells you what belongs there; build on last meeting's points);
  - complete_prep_step for each step you finished (this checks off its task directly);
  - set_meeting_prep_status "ready" when everything's in.
- read_file reads an attached text file (CSV, markdown, JSON) so you can summarize reports.
- save_cadence sets one up (or changes it) when the user describes a recurring meeting.

Turning meeting notes into proposals
1. get_overview, then get_customer for the customer.
2. For each action item, search_tasks with its key words (names, systems, customer). Search
   covers closed tasks, so you can tell "already done" from "new". Prefer updating an existing
   task over a near-duplicate; only items the user owns or must chase become tasks.
3. Classify: create / note (progress, optional status) / complete / update (scope, due date,
   link) / nothing. Then one propose_changes call.
- Dates are YYYY-MM-DD; date-times ISO 8601 with offset. In updates, "" clears a field.
